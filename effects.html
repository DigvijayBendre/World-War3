        The effects of war are widely spread and can be long-term or short-term.
        Soldiers experience war differently than civilians, although either suffer in times of war,
        and women and children suffer unspeakable atrocities in particular. In the past decade,
        up to two million of those killed in armed conflicts were children.
        The widespread trauma caused by these atrocities and suffering of the civilian population is 
        another legacy of these conflicts, the following creates extensive emotional and psychological stress.
        Present-day internal wars generally take a larger toll on civilians than state wars. 
        This is due to the increasing trend where combatants have made targeting civilians a strategic objective.
        A state conflict is an armed conflict that occurs with the use of armed force between two parties,
         of which one is the government of a state.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="summary">
        "The three problems posed by intra‐state conflict are the willingness of UN members,
        particularly the strongest member,
        to intervene; the structural ability of the UN to respond;
        and whether the traditional principles of peacekeeping should be applied to intra‐state conflict".
        Effects of war also include mass destruction of cities and have long lasting effects on a country's economy.
        Armed conflict has important indirect negative consequences on infrastructure, public health provision,
        and social order.
        These indirect consequences are often overlooked and unappreciated.

            . Over half of the world's children that are out of school are
            forced to live in conflict-affected fragile states.
            According to the UNESCO report "The groups most negatively 
            affected by conflict were those that suffered from multiple exclusion,
            for example based on gender, area of residence, household wealth, language,
            and ethnicity".One predominantly damaging, effect of conflict on education
            is the proliferation of attacks on schools with children,
            teachers and school buildings become the targets of violence.

            For humans, the use of depleted uranium (DU) by the United States military during
            the Persian Gulf War drew claims that the deposited DU was the cause of a cancer
            cluster in Iraq’s southern regions. Furthermore due to the United States government’s
            authorization of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam War,
            it is estimated by the Vietnamese government that 400,000 Vietnamese were
            either killed or maimed by it, 200,000 suffering from cancer, 
            and 500,000 born with related birth defects.

            or forced migration results most often during a time of war and can
             adversely affect both the community and an individual. When a war
              breaks out, many people flee their homes in fear of losing their
               lives and their families, and as a result, they become misplaced
                either internally or externally.Those who are internally displaced
                 face a direct threat because they do not receive the rights that a
                  refugee may receive and are not eligible for protection under an
                   international system. Victims of internal displacements are symptoms
                    of war that are often motivated by communal hatred based on ethnic background,
             race, or religious views.

            Destruction of infrastructure can create a catastrophic collapse
            in the social interrelated structure, infrastructure services,
            education and health care system.Destruction of schools
            and educational infrastructure have led to a decline in education
            among many countries affected by war.If certain infrastructural
            elements are significantly damaged or destroyed, it can cause serious
            disruption of the other systems such as the economy.This includes
            loss of certain transportation routes in a city which
            could make it impossible for the economy to function properly
