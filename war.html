        Throughout world history, countless wars have been fought around
        the globe over issues ranging from religious differences, territorial
        disputes, politics, and ethnicity. While war, in itself, is always
        destructive (and costly), there exists a handful of wars in history
        that have proven quite devastating in regard to both deaths and overall
        destruction. This work examines the top 10 deadliest wars in human history.
        It provides an analysis of each conflict’s origins, overall death toll,
        and casualties (war-related injuries) in regard to both the military and
        civilian sector. It is this author’s hope that a better understanding of
        the destructive capacity of war will accompany readers following their 
        completion of this work.

             Second World War (or World War II) refers to a massive global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945,
             and which involved nearly all of the world’s countries. Divided into two separate camps
             (the Axis vs. the Allies), the two military alliances engaged in total war for nearly
             six years with devastating consequences in terms of both death and destruction.
             In total, an estimated 100-million military personnel from approximately thirty
             different countries were thrust into the conflict with horrific consequences.
             The conflict left in its wake thousands of destroyed cities and millions of lost lives.

            Second Sino-Japanese War refers to a conflict between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan.
            Lasting from 7 July 1937 to 2 September 1945, the war is widely considered one of the bloodiest 
            conflicts in human history as Japanese forces raped, pillaged, and killed countless Chinese civilians 
            and military personnel in their quest for victory.
            The conflict began as a result of the Japanese Empire seeking
            to expand its control (and influence) into the heart of Asia where resources, labor,
            and food were plentiful for their growing empire.

            (or Taiping Civil War) refers to a civil war that took place in China between 1850 and 1864 among
            the Qing government and Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Led by an individual named Hong Xiuquan
            (who believed he was the brother of Jesus Christ), the Taiping forces waged a nationalist,
            political, and religious war against the Qing Dynasty with the goal of converting the Chinese
            people to Christianity (and toppling the Qing government in the process). Based in modern-day
            Nanjing, the Taiping rebels managed to take control of significant portions of South China
            with an estimated 30 million people falling under their control at the height of their power.

            The First World War, also known as the “Great War,”
            was a worldwide conflict that originated in Europe
            on 28 July 1914. Lasting four years, the war resulted
            in the mobilization of approximately 70 million military
            personnel as the European continent was engulfed by conflict
            in nearly every corner of the map. When the fighting finally
            ceased in November 1918, Europe faced devastation on a scale
            never before seen in history as the continent experienced widespread political, social, economic,
            and cultural changes in the conflict’s wake
