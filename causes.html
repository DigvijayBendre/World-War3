      <p class="summary">
        War is, sadly, part and parcel of human history. As far as we can tell,
        humans have been at it for as long as our species has existed on this
        planet - and animals were in conflict before us. Some of the earliest
        evidence of warfare was unearthed in Kenya, where anthropologists
        uncovered remains of people who had died violently sometimes between
        9,500 and 10,500 years ago - the earliest scientifically-dated evidence
        of organized human violence. War could be a consequence of our biology,
        or a completely human construct initiated and maintained by organized
        societies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="summary">
        The triggers for war are pretty diverse but generally center around some
        common themes like the need for resources, conflicting ideas, expansion
        of territory, revenge for perceived wrongs, frustration with the status
        quo (i.e. revolution). The two major world wars of the 20th-century
        include some aspects of all of these, with the complication that WW1 was
        largely seen as an unsatisfactory end to the burning pressures between
        interested parties. This, according to some, laid the ground for WW2,
        and, to a certain extent, continued into the Cold War and beyond.

            has been the result of, not the cause of conflict. The Hunnic
            invasions of the 5th Century being a good example. But some believe
            that the kind of mass migration we have seen over the last
            decade or so could set the scene for conflict in the not too distant
            future. The reason for them
            vary from civil wars to environmental disasters or economic
            desperation. And these issues are likely only going to get worse as
            populations rise.

            is a historical event and it's effects will likely ripple
            out for years to come. Countries across the globe are already rethinking
            their entire foreign policy, and
            that's just the beginning. Every government will be watching closely
            to see what unfolds in Ukraine and whether the global response to
            Russia is able to deter even greater escalation. It's worth
            remembering that we're only a week into this war and things are
            changing by the day. No one really knows how it will play out.

            is something of unfinished business for the Chinese Communist Party.
            After the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War in the 1940s, remnants
            of the defeated Kuomintang controlled Republic of China
            took refuge on the island. The People's Republic of China (PRC), to this
            day, considers Taiwan as part of China and does not recognize the
            legitimacy of the ROC. If China decides to invade the island, this
            could, trigger a chain of events that could escalate very
            quickly.

            The world's population is around 8 billion today. This is set to
            grow to 10 billion by 2050. That's 2 billion more mouths to feed & water. While
            some are confident technological improvements and management
            strategies can handle it, others are concerned that this might reach
            a tipping point in which demand outstrips supply. If the pessimists
            are right, water and food shortages will likely not be taken lightly
            by much of the world's population. After all, food scarcity was one
